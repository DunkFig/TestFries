I’ll be far away, my sights trained from the tedium of measured breath and drones, eyes plump, fixated on some stale dry light. All I am is a receptacle for media - a lie (although perhaps the inverse of a lie). I submit to its steady bludgeoning flow.","It starts again: Big-blue-sky commercials where we turn into metal and fly through the suburbs. Giant shoes we sit in like sarcophagi sprout wings, delivering us to the clouds. I am giant, powerful and kind, I help the townsfolk move their city. Repeated frequently enough to be rehearsed mentally. Why - at 5 - at my most free, am I perpetually being sold ‘freedom’.","At 4. I wake up inside my own frozen body. Down the hallway bounce colorful reflections from the TV - out of direct sight, but heard clearly. The connection between my body and mind is lost, no little voice escapes me. The specter of every vestige flails riotously, unable to persuade the flesh, the result is a psychic pain. I am forced to watch the residual light - from commercials, sitcoms, laugh tracks, and jingles. The light feels sentient, like an alien swarm that occupies real space in my home. I can’t move my mouth, or muster air from my lungs to scream. It sits there watching me without malice or spite.","Hell is Crimson with highlights of tangerine and lows of deep maroon. God is a white man with long hair and a girlish face. Satan is a faceless liar with horns. Each night they perform for the sake of my immortal soul. They take up space in my mind's eye, wrestling with each other until I get tired. Tension, but a comic tension, each of them too archetypal to be real. This new third thing is too filled out to be Lucifer or Jesus Christ - it could encompass each of them simultaneously. True god.","Atoms from a cathode ray, shot at high speeds to create the illusion of an image, the same image all across the world - at the same time, same thing. Its ghost tangled up in dark hallways, swung under ceiling fans, casting long shadows with a shimmering blanket. The numb mumur of constricted limbs - incarnate and curious. Its breath displaces waves of itself across the floor. Passive, calm and unaware of the superficial minutiae that takes place on its surface; it doesn’t care about shoes, cigarettes, or junk food - It just wants to spread out. Is it Impossible to believe that something as simple as entropy could be kind? ","This is what sees me, this is what I see. Just barely out of reach. My body - still broken. It’s focus collapses into mine, dissolving my identity and fear into something larger - falling. 15 second intervals each marching in different directions, I am torn from myself and feel freedom for the first time."],hiddenEssay=["lorem"],levels=7,vertexY=[],vertexX=[],fries=document.getElementById("fries"),vid=document.getElementById("video0"),textDiv=document.getElementById("sideText"),backText=document.getElementById("backgroundText");function setup(){createCanvas(windowWidth+1e3,windowHeight).parent("container")}function draw(){if(background(220,0,0,0),noFill(),vertexY.length<levels){beginShape();for(let e=0;e<vertexY.length;e++)vertex(vertexX[e],vertexY[e]),textSize(16),stroke(0),fill(0,255,0),text("truth",vertexX[e]+10,vertexY[e]-10,100,100),fill(255,0,0,1),strokeWeight(1),stroke(0,255,0);endShape(CLOSE)}}function mousePressed(){0==countDownVar?(countDown(),vertexY.push(mouseY),vertexX.push(mouseX),backText.innerHTML=" ",document.getElementById("go").play(),windowResized(),vertexY.length<levels&&(text("truth",mouseX+10,mouseY-10,20,20),textDiv.innerHTML="",textDiv.append(myEssay[vertexY.length-1]),fries.playbackRate=1/vertexY.length,vid.playbackRate=1*vertexY.length),vertexY.length===levels&&(fill(255,0,0),stroke(0),textDiv.innerHTML="",textDiv.append(myEssay[vertexY.length-1]),backText.append(myEssay[vertexY.length-1]),text("the only lie",mouseX+10,mouseY-10,20,100),countDownVar=0),vertexY.length>levels&&(textDiv.innerHTML="",goodBye())):countDownVar>0&&vertexY.length<levels&&(clear(),stroke(0),fill(0,0,255),text("You can't move.",mouseX+10,mouseY-10,100,100),document.getElementById("error").play())}function goodBye(){clear(),background(53,37,232),document.getElementById("container").style.zIndex="50000",textDiv.remove(),setTimeout((function(){close()}),5e3)}function windowResized(){resizeCanvas(windowWidth,windowHeight)}</script><script>let countDownVar=0;function countDown(){console.log("popp"),countDownVar=1500,function n(){setTimeout((function(){if(countDownVar>0&&countDownVar<=1500){if(countDownVar-=1,countDownVar%17==0){backText.append(myEssay[vertexY.length-1]);document.createElement("div7")}document.getElementById("counter").style.color="#55a9e6";let o=document.getElementById("counter");o.innerHTML=" ",o.append(countDownVar),n()}countDownVar<500&&countDownVar>0?(countDownVar-=1,document.getElementById("counter").style.color="#ff0019"):countDownVar<=0&&(countDownVar=0,document.getElementById("counter").style.color="#80f56c",document.getElementById("counter").innerHTML="GO")}),10)}()}</script><script>let buttonEnter=document.getElementById("entryBut"),loadingScreen=document.getElementById("loading");buttonEnter.addEventListener("click",(function(){document.getElementById("main").requestFullscreen(),buttonEnter.remove(),loadingScreen.remove(),fries.play()}))</script></div></main></body></html>
